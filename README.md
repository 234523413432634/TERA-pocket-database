# TERA pocket database

![tumbnail](imgs/tumb.png)

A version-agnostic portable item database for TERA online.

How to use:

1. Download a build from the releases tab.

2. If you want a DB for 31.04, 71.03 or 92.04 EUR game version, then just launch the TERADB.exe

3. If you need a different language/game version, then unpack a client datacenter for your version of choice, then find "EquipmentData", "ItemData" and "StrSheet_Item" folders.

4. In the TERA_DB folder, create the folder for your database, consisting of a number and a name. For example, a folder named "4. MyDB"  would add a fourth database named "MyDB"

5. Copy the "EquipmentData", "ItemData" and "StrSheet_Item" from unpacked datacenter into folder youâ€™ve created in the previous step. That's it.

Known issues:

The search is case insensitive if you use the english language. Other languages might be case-sensitive.

The dark theme has a couple of small visual issues
